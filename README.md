## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project that applies Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms to optimize ad selections based on historical ad performance data. The dataset includes 15,000 instances across 10 different ad variants, providing a rich basis for applying and comparing these reinforcement learning techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical operations
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib (optional):** Library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python

## Features

### Algorithm Implementation

- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Balances exploration and exploitation, taking into account both the average reward of ads and how often they have been selected.
- **Thompson Sampling:** A probabilistic algorithm that considers the Bayesian inference for selecting the ad.

### Data Analysis

- **Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Performance Analysis:** Evaluate the performance of different ads based on historical data.
- **Visualization:** Visualize ad performance and algorithm results.

### Performance Comparison

- **Efficiency:** Evaluate the efficiency of the UCB and Thompson Sampling algorithms.
- **Effectiveness:** Compare the effectiveness of the algorithms based on cumulative rewards and scalability.
