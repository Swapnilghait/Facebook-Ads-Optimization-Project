# Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project that applies Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms to optimize ad selections based on historical ad performance data. The dataset includes 15,000 instances across 10 different ad variants, providing a rich basis for applying and comparing these reinforcement learning techniques.

# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language
NumPy: Library for numerical operations
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib (optional): Library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python

# Features
Algorithm Implementation:
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): Balances exploration and exploitation, taking into account both the average reward of ads and how often they have been selected.
Thompson Sampling: A probabilistic algorithm that considers the Bayesian inference for selecting the ad.
Data Analysis: Includes data preprocessing, analysis of ad performance, and visualization of results.
Performance Comparison: Evaluates the efficiency and effectiveness of the two algorithms based on the cumulative reward and scalability.
